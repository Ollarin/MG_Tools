Yes this project needs the help from the community, even though many many people suggested me to sell my stuff I am not going to do so. I am a fan of open source , I have learned so much from many people and I like to give it back to the community. This is the first release so ant feedback and bug reports is more then welcome. Also most of the nodes comes with source code so if you like to recompile it for a missing version of maya or os you are more then welcome to do so , send it to me and I will upload it and get credits for it!. Also you are free to expand nodes or creates python script for easily hooking up the nodes and so on. Every help is more then welcome and everyone that helps will get credits. For now the repository will be accesible for push only upon requesto , otherwise mail me any material you wish to see uploaded at\-: marco(dot)giordano(dot)work(at)gmail(dot)com

In this repository you can find the source of most of my nodes , I decided to not build the single nodes but to build bundles . There are currently two bundles \-: M\-G\-\_\-tools\-Lite M\-G\-\_\-tools\-Pro

M\-G\-\_\-tools\-Lite comes with all the plugins with source code and can be recompiled from everyone M\-G\-\_\-tools\-Pro comes only with the build plugin and contains some extra nodes for which I did not release the source

M\-G\-\_\-tools\-Lite content \-: \begin{DoxyVerb}- MG_nurbsRivet (MTypeId(0x80000));

I think doxygen is an awesome tool, that's why I decided to use it. Since I am still human, probably there are mistakes in the doc here and there , help me fix them with some p2p review. If you spot an error or some doc missing like an undocumented param and so on mail me at\-: marco(dot)giordano(dot)work(at)gmail(dot)com
