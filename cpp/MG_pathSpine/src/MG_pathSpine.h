/** \brief lets build a fast and flexible spine
*/

/**
* @author Marco Giordano
* @date  02/10/2013
* @version latest version : V1
* @version changeload versions : \n
*			V1 : \n
*				- initial release \n				
*
*
* node name : MG_pathSpine.
* 
* details : This node lets build a fast and flexible spine with a lot of features like 
*			hardcore twisting , squash and stretch and more.
*			NB : this nodes have as output severl arrays (translate ,rotate and scale),
*			maya is really picky about arrays , if you try to acces an index that is not there
*			well your going to crash.
*			In order to avoid that be sure that the value of the attribute "number of outputs"
*			is equal at the number of index in all output array , even if you dont conncet them create
*			the index , otherwise the compute wont start.
*			Example if you have number of outputs : 20 you will need to have as last index for example 
*			outputTranslate[19] , (array index count starts from 0 ).
*			In order to create index if you dont have to connect them you can simply use a getAttr command on the
*			indexes.
*			Also be sure to set the start length value of the curve.
*			I really hope someone from the community will provide scripts to hook up the node ,
*			I did it for myself but it s based on my pipeline I am currently developing so I can't share.
*
*			
* example create node : (MEL) createNode MG_pathSpine.
